# Accident-detection-prevention-and-reporting-system

A groundbreaking embedded systems project aimed at enhancing road safety through innovative technology.

The Accident Prevention, Detection and Reporting System is an advanced safety solution, integrating an alcohol sensor, eye blink sensor, Accelerometer sensor, GPS, and GSM modules for comprehensive driver well-being and road safety. It monitors alcohol levels, driver alertness, and responds to impacts. The GPS module provides real-time location data, while the GSM module enables instant communication, sending SMS alerts with the driver's precise location. The system, designed for seamless motor control, allows remote operation through a dedicated mobile app, ensuring a secure driving experience and prompt emergency response. This project aims to revolutionize automotive safety, prioritizing both driver safety and efficient emergency communication.

This project includes the development of  accident detection system by integrating components such as Sim900A GSM module and Sim28ML GPS modules for real-time communication and precise GPS tracking and, an MQ-3 gas sensor for environmental monitoring, an accelerometer for impact detection, and a motor driver interfaced with an Arduino Mega for responsive control.

 The interconnected system demonstrates a integrates of communication, sensing, and control technologies, enhancing emergency response mechanisms. The report provides insights into the integration process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented, during the development of this prototype.
